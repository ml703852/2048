## Gameplay:
```
At the beginning of the game, the 4x4 grid is empty.

With each turn, a new tile with a value of either 2 or 4 will appear on the grid at a random position.

Use the control keys to shift the tiles in the desired direction (up, down, left, or right).

All tiles will slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid.

If two tiles with the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a single tile with the sum of their values.

After each move, a new tile will appear on the grid.

Continue making moves and merging tiles to reach the 2048 tile.

The game ends when you either reach the 2048 tile (win) or there are no more valid moves and the board is full (lose).
```

## Note:

The game will display the current state of the board after each move.

To quit the game at any time, press the q key.
